[Term]
id: GO:1903019
name: negative regulation of glycoprotein metabolic process
namespace: biological_process
def: "Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of glycoprotein metabolic process." [GO_REF:0000058, GOC:BHF, GOC:rl, GOC:TermGenie, PMID:23544079]
comment: human serum amyloid P component (SAP) P02743 inhibits viral neuraminidase, NA (exo-alpha-sialidase activity) and thus the metabolism of glycoproteins, demonstrated in Figure 4A PMID:23544079, (IDA), the negative regulation term would be applied to this protein
