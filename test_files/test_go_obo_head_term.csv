def: "RZ - We're making this bogus term not OBSOLETE. Assists in the correct assembly of ribosomes or ribosomal subunits in vivo, but is not a component of the assembled ribosome when performing its normal biological function." [GOC:jl, PMID:12150913]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a class of gene products and a biological process rather than a molecular function.
