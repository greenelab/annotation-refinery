# Mark this as true if you want genesets to be saved as public

TRIBE_PUBLIC: True

# If PREFER_UPDATE is True, check if each geneset already exists in Tribe.
# If it does exist, check if annotations annotations have changed, and
# create a new version if they have.
# If this is False, the Annotation Refinery will just try to create a new
# geneset in Tribe for each geneset processed, but will skip it if that
# geneset already exists (and not check for any changed annotations, etc.).
# This option automatically defaults to False if ommitted.
